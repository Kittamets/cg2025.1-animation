# Computer Graphics - Assignment 1

## Project Overview

This project is a **600x600 animation** created using the **Java 2D API**. The theme for this animation is **"WHAT IF I REBORNED"**, and it uses a variety of graphics techniques such as **lines, curves**, and one of the **midpoint algorithms** (either midpoint circle or midpoint ellipse) to generate the visual effect.

The animation will run for at least **5 seconds**.

## Features
- **Canvas Size:** 600x600 pixels.
- **Animation Theme:** "WHAT IF I REBORNED."
- **Graphics Techniques Used:**
  - Drawing **lines** and **curves**.
  - Implementing the **Midpoint Circle Algorithm** or the **Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm** for drawing shapes.
- **Java 2D API** for graphics rendering and animation.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 8 or higher.
- **Java 2D API** - Utilized for all graphical operations.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Navigate to the project folder

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <repository_directory>
```

###  3. Compile the Java file

Inside the project folder, you’ll find a single Java file. To compile the Java file, run the following command:

```bash
javac <file_name>.java
```

This will compile the `<file_name>.java` file and generate a `<file_name>.class` file.

### 4. Run the Program

After compiling, run the program using the following command:

```bash
java <file_name>
```

This will start the animation, and it will run for at least 5 seconds. The animation will appear in a 600x600 canvas.
